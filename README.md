# Interactive_Dashboard_On_Excel

In this project, I created an interactive and dynamic dashboard using excel on sales data, these are the following steps I took:  

1. Cleaning the data:  
  - Removing blank rows 
  - Removing duplicates 
  - Correcting the formats of the different variables 

2. Data analysis: I created multiple charts and tables using different calculations
  - Filled map
  - Stacked chart
  - Doughnut chart
  - Dynamic tables

3. KPIs:
  - Sales performance usind conditional formatting 

4. Dashboard: 
  - Using a combo box to select a certain year to visualize the different charts and maps
